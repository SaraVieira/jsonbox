# jsonbox.io

A HTTP based JSON storage. It lets you store, read & modify JSON data over HTTP APIs for FREE. Ideal for small projects, prototypes or hackathons, where you don't have to spin up your own data store.

With the new protected boxes (introduced in v2), you can even power your websites with jsonbox.io.

> :warning: **30 days of data retention:** Data older than 30 days will be deleted automatically. *Note: Updated data will be deleted 30 days from the updated date.*

## API Documentation

Base URL: `https://jsonbox.io/`

### Create

You can create a record (or add a record) to a box by using HTTP post to `jsonbox.io/${BOX_ID}`.

```sh
curl -X POST 'https://jsonbox.io/demobox_6d9e326c183fde7b' \
    -H 'content-type: application/json' \
    -d '{"name": "Jon Snow", "age": 25}'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "_id": "5d776a25fd6d3d6cb1d45c51",
  "name": "Jon Snow",
  "age": 25,
  "_createdOn": "2019-09-10T09:17:25.607Z"
}
```

You can also create multiple records at once by passing an array

```sh
curl -X POST 'https://jsonbox.io/demobox_6d9e326c183fde7b' \
    -H 'content-type: application/json' \
    -d '[{"name": "Daenerys Targaryen", "age": 25}, {"name": "Arya Stark", "age": 16}]'
```

```json
[
  {
    "_id": "5d776b75fd6d3d6cb1d45c52",
    "name": "Daenerys Targaryen",
    "age": 25,
    "_createdOn": "2019-09-10T09:23:01.105Z"
  },
  {
    "_id": "5d776b75fd6d3d6cb1d45c53",
    "name": "Arya Stark",
    "age": 16,
    "_createdOn": "2019-09-10T09:23:01.105Z"
  }
]
```

You can also pass in an optional collections parameter in the URL to group records `jsonbox.io/${BOX_ID}/${COLLECTION}`.

_Note: A valid `${BOX_ID}` & `${COLLECTION}` should contain only alphanumeric characters & \_. `${BOX_ID}` should be at least 20 characters long._

### Read

Use HTTP GET to read all the records or a single record. You can also query & sort the records.

```sh
curl -X GET 'https://jsonbox.io/demobox_6d9e326c183fde7b'
```

```json
[
  {
    "_id": "5d776b75fd6d3d6cb1d45c52",
    "name": "Daenerys Targaryen",
    "age": 25,
    "_createdOn": "2019-09-10T09:23:01.105Z"
  },
  {
    "_id": "5d776b75fd6d3d6cb1d45c53",
    "name": "Arya Stark",
    "age": 16,
    "_createdOn": "2019-09-10T09:23:01.105Z"
  },
  {
    "_id": "5d776a25fd6d3d6cb1d45c51",
    "name": "Jon Snow",
    "age": 25,
    "_createdOn": "2019-09-10T09:17:25.607Z"
  }
]
```

To get all records inside a collection _Sample collection name: "users"_:

```sh
curl -X GET 'https://jsonbox.io/demobox_6d9e326c183fde7b/users'
```

To sort the records by a specific field use `sort` query param. In the below example the output will be sorted in the descending order of the age.

```sh
curl -X GET 'https://jsonbox.io/demobox_6d9e326c183fde7b?sort=-age'
```

To read a specific record use `jsonbox.io/${BOX_ID}/${RECORD_ID}`.

```sh
curl -X GET 'https://jsonbox.io/demobox_6d9e326c183fde7b/5d776a25fd6d3d6cb1d45c51'
```

To query records, you have to pass the key & value as shown below.

```sh
curl -X GET 'https://jsonbox.io/demobox_6d9e326c183fde7b?q=name:arya%20stark'
```

All the accepted query params are as follows.

| Param | Description                                                                                   | Default      |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| sort  | Used to sort the result set by the specific field. Add a prefix "-" to sort in reverse order. | -\_createdOn |
| skip  | Used to skip certain no. of records. Can be used for pagination.                              | 0            |
| limit | Used to limit the results to a specific count. Can be used for pagination. Max. is 1000.      | 20           |
| q     | Query for filtering values. Check out the format below.                                       |              |

#### Filtering

You can pass a filter in a query by passing them in URL param `q` as shown below:

```sh
curl -X GET 'https://jsonbox.io/demobox_6d9e326c183fde7b?q=name:arya%20stark,age:>13'
```

The above sample will look for the name `arya stark` and age greater than 13. You can filter on `Number`, `String` & `Boolean` values only.

Different filters for Numeric values.

|                                                                      | Sample                       |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| To filter values greater than or less than a specific value          | `q=age:>10` or `q=age:<10`   |
| To filter values greater (or less) than or equal to a specific value | `q=age:>=10` or `q=age:<=10` |
| To filter values that match a specific value.                        | `q=age:=10`                  |

Different filters for String values.

|                                                                    | Sample                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------- |
| Filter values that start with a specific string                    | `q=name:arya*`        |
| Filter values that end with a specific string                      | `q=name:*stark`       |
| Filter values where a specific string appears anywhere in a string | `q=name:*ya*`         |
| Filter values that match a specific string                         | `q=name:arya%20stark` |

You can combine multiple fields by separating them with commas as shown below:

```
https://jsonbox.io/demobox_6d9e326c183fde7b?q=name:arya%20stark,age:>13,isalive:true
```

### Update

Use HTTP PUT to update record one by one. Please note that this will not patch the record, it is full update. _A Bulk update is not supported yet._

```sh
curl -X PUT 'https://jsonbox.io/demobox_6d9e326c183fde7b/5d776b75fd6d3d6cb1d45c53' \
    -H 'content-type: application/json' \
    -d '{"name": "Arya Stark", "age": 18}'
```

### Delete

Two approaches are available for delete

- To delete a specific record use HTTP DELETE with jsonbox.io/${BOX_ID}/${RECORD_ID}

```sh
curl -X DELETE 'https://jsonbox.io/demobox_6d9e326c183fde7b/5d776b75fd6d3d6cb1d45c53'
```

- To delete based on a filter use HTTP DELETE with jsonbox.io/\${BOX_ID}?q={QUERY}

```sh
curl -X DELETE 'https://jsonbox.io/demobox_6d9e326c183fde7b?q=name:arya%20stark,age:>13'
```

### Protected Box

A **protected box** is similar to a regular box, but you need an API-KEY to create / update / delete records. _Reading records is open and does not need API-KEY_. Pass the API-KEY using the `X-API-KEY` HTTP header.

```sh
curl -X POST 'https://jsonbox.io/demobox_6d9e326c183fde7b' \
    -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --H 'x-api-key: 7b3b910b-a7ad-41e8-89d6-5e28e2e34e70' \
    -d '{"name": "Jon Snow", "age": 25}'
```

You can also use `Authorization: API-KEY 7b3b910b-a7ad-41e8-89d6-5e28e2e34e70` header. _An API-KEY should be a valid GUID/UUID._

#### How to create a protected box?

You create a protected box by pushing your first record to a new box with an API-KEY. All the subsequent write requests to that box expect the API-KEY to be passed. _You cannot change a public box to protected or vice versa._

### Getting Box metadata

Use `/_meta/${BOX_ID}` in a `GET` request to get metadata of a box

```
https://jsonbox.io/_meta/demobox_6d9e326c183fde7b
```

The result will have the following format

```json
{
  "_count": 3,
  "_createdOn": "2020-03-12T04:45:22.000Z",
  "_updatedOn": "2020-03-12T06:23:26.000Z"
}
```

- `_count` - the record count in the box
- `_createdOn` - the oldest record's created date
- `_updatedOn` - the most recent updated date

### Optional IP Filtering
When running your own instance localy, you could define IP Address filtering.  
Set the value of `FILTER_IP_SET` in config.js to the set of allowed IP addresses.

Single IP:
```
FILTER_IP_SET: ['192.168.1.123']
```

Using CIDR subnet masks for ranges:
```
FILTER_IP_SET: ['127.0.0.1/24']
```

Using IP ranges:
```
FILTER_IP_SET: [['127.0.0.1', '127.0.0.10']]
```

Using wildcard ip ranges and nginx forwarding:
```
FILTER_IP_SET: ['10.1.*.*', '123.??.34.8*']
```

### Limitations

This is FREE service, so we have to have some limitations to avoid abuse and stay free forever.

1. The request body cannot be more than 50KB.
2. Can't push or pull more than 1000 records at a time.
3. `POST` requests are rate-limited to 100 per hour per IP address
4. There is no limit on the number of records you store in a box, but please don't abuse the API by storing large datasets of more than **5000** records. This is meant for small projects and that's why it is offered FREE of cost.
5. 30 days of data retention. 
6. No backup. If your data is lost due to some technical issues, its lost forever.
